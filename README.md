How to compile the poster:
- Download all github repositories specified in fork_detector.py
- Currently all repositories and their paths are hardcoded in fork_detector.py, I was too lazy to change it.
- Install tsc and py as well as some python dependencies
- run make poster and inspect in your browser
- The poster magic currently happens inside d3.ts
